I'm **Hans Montcho**, a PhD candidate in the [Statistics Program](https://stat.kaust.edu.sa/) at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology-KAUST](https://kaust.edu.sa/en/). I'm currently advised by [Haavard Rue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VJOn_ZkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and [David Bolin](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=GNOopfAAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis is centered around Latent Gaussian Models, Bayesian Computation, Cross Validation and Point Process models.


# News 

- **Academic Visit** 

Until mid June 2025, I am visiting the [Probabilistic Machine Learning Group at Aalto University](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) working with [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/)   on topics related to  Cross Validation, Bayesian workflow, Simulation Based Calibration and Priors specification.

- **Bayes Comp 2025**

I will attend  the [Bayes Comp 2025](https://bayescomp2025.sg/) and  present our new work on Skewed Posterior Approximations in Latent Gaussian Models using Variational Bayes and orthogonal Polynomials.  


- **RSS Conference 2025**

I will attend the [RSS Conference 2025](https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2025/)  giving a talk on validating and comparing Log Gaussian Cox Process models.
